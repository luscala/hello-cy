# hello-cy
That's just a quick start with Cypress!

# Why
Today I've some spare time and I'd give Cypress a try. I've never been on the QA side, but I spent the last 2 years in troubleshooting - or maybe fighting? - with a Protractor test suite. So that's why I'm playing around with Cypress.

# What
There you'll not find more than an initial Cypress workspace setup, plus TypeScript. I'll not write a blog post on this topic: the Cypress documentation is clear enough.
